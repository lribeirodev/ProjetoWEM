<h2> Notes: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Aspect #1 When creating CTD we should consider images references for desktop, and mobile</li>
<li>Aspect #2 The mockup is just a base to the possible real model, however, while making implementation the database could be altered, for example, a table, a column name URL_IMAGE_DESKTOP is better than URL_IMAGE because the more specific will turn things easy for the user to understand the implementation that was used for.</li>
<li>Aspect #3 While shaping the page, we will consider that one element will be used to make a component, this is a SHAPE for our CAKE, now repeated images and text will use one CTD to make many content instances and pointing to references inside the database.</li>
</ul>
